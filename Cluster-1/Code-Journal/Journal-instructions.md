Assignments

1. Code Journals

Mastery of a skill comes from immersing yourself in the study and use of it in many different ways.

For the Code Study Journal, you will need to complete 3 code journals per week for the first three weeks (due by Sunday midnight UTC). You will send these to GitHub-as prescribed for all Cohort work [NOTE: each journal entry should focus on 30-50 lines of code- meaning your total annotations should be between 90-150. If you end up doing a single contract that is 90-150 lines, that works for all 3 that week]

Here are the steps to complete each one:

1. Select a piece of code/ smart contract. To start there will be choices provided, or you can find a sample on your own- this Solana repo are a great resource you will learn to use during this course. It is a collection of programs, many of which are production ready. The faster you get comfortable with these examples,, the better off you will be.

2. Annotate the code- in other words, make notes on the document explaining what is happening through the code.

- What are the concepts (borrowing, ownership, vectors etc)
- What is the organization?
- What is the contract doing? What is the mechanism?
- How could it be better? More efficient? Safer?
- As we shift to week 2, your lens of Native Rust -> Anchor should be explored, annotated, and analyzed.

3.  Make a video of your code study, once a month, and show an example of how you made the code better, test, compile, and deploy it on video.
